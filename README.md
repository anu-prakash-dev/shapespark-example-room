You can view the model in 3D here: https://demo.shapespark.com/example-room/#autoplay

The model is distributed toghether with
[Shapespark](https://www.shapespark.com) application, but we make it
available also on GitHub to allow modifying the model and to enable
experimenting with other rendering engines. The model is prepared for
real-time rendering, so it is a complete interior with correct faces
orientation and without any missing walls. The geometry has **1.2**
million trianges.

The provided model doesn't contain lightmap uvs and lightmap textures
that are visible on the screenshots above, the lighting on the
screenshots was added by the Shapespark engine.

The model is available in [GLTF](./shapespark-example-room-gltf.zip), [FBX](./shapespark-example-room-fbx.zip), [Blender](./shapespark-example-room.blend.zip) and [Sketchup](./shapespark-example-room.skp) formats.
